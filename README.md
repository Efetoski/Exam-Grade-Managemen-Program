Write a program to provide some grade management software for a university. 
1. Define a function that takes the results list as an argument and prints out a pass list,
printing each studentâ€™s name, score and grading (use distinction 70%, merit 60% and
pass 40% grading schema).
2. Define a function that takes the results list as an argument and prints out a list of all
students that have failed with a mark below 40%, but where all students with a mark
of 30-39 are entitled to a resubmission.
3. Define a function that takes the results list and returns the following performance
statistics, printing them out after the two results lists:
a. Highest mark and student
b. Marks range (highest and lowest)
c. Average mark overall
