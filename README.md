# Exam-Grade-Management-Program
Write a program to provide some grade management software for a university. Download
and edit the files TUT_results.ipynb python code and TUT_datafile.py from
Blackboard to proceed with this exercise. Do not be afraid to initially experiment with the
files to see how they work!
1. Define a function that takes the results list as an argument and prints out a pass list,
printing each studentâ€™s name, score and grading (use distinction 70%, merit 60% and
pass 40% grading schema).
2. Define a function that takes the results list as an argument and prints out a list of all
students that have failed with a mark below 40%, but where all students with a mark
of 30-39 are entitled to a resubmission.
3. Define a function that takes the results list and returns the following performance
statistics, printing them out after the two results lists:
a. Highest mark and student
b. Marks range (highest and lowest)
c. Average mark overall
4. Define a function that returns how many students scored above the average and
how many below, including failures and print these statistics.
